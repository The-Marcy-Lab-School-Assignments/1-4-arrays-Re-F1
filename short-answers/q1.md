# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
let name = "mike";
const changeName = (nameToChange) => {
  nameToChange = "tom";
};
changeName(name);
console.log(name);

const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Why was `favoriteLocations` changed, but `name` was not?

# Answer
> `favoriteLocations` was changed from :

"New York City", "Jersey City " 

to

"Boston", "New York City", "Jersey City" 

because the function `addBostonToFavorites` is inside the function `favoriteLocations`

> The reason why `tom` was not printed is because the `let name` variable is declared outside of the function

# Teacher Feedback
favoriteLocations was changed because arrays pass references that can be mutated, while name was not changed because it's an immutable string.
