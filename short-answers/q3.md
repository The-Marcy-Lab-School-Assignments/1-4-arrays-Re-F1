# Question
Check out [the docs for the rest operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters) for this question.

What's the difference between the spread operator and the rest operator?

# Answer

The difference between `spread` syntax and `rest` operator is:

> SPREAD : Spread syntax "expands" an array into its elements
>
> Can be used outside of function parameters
```js
const sugg1 = ['Can', 'we', 'get'];
const sugg_2 = ['assignments', 'once', 'a', 'week PLEASEE'];
const combinedArray = [...sugg1, ...sugg_2];
console.log(combinedArray); // [ 'Can', 'we', 'get', 'assignments', 'once', 'a', 'week PLEASEE' ]
```

> REST : collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element
>
> specifically used in function parameters
